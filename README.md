### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The I.T. area is fantastic. Even when I had no direct involvement, I was already enchanted by technology, like the fact that processes happen in an accelerated way and is always in constant evolution.
When I started to interact with this world more closely and understand how it worked, I fell in love with it.One of the parts that fascinates me is programming. From structured languages â€‹â€‹to those that are object oriented, each one, with its differences and similarities, brought me more pleasure in learning and discovering how far I could go.
Trying, failing, understanding and being able to execute were / are / will be my routines and I love it.
